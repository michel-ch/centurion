## Exercise Illustrations

The app uses a placeholder system for exercise images. To add real illustrations:

1. Create WebP images (800px wide, 16:9 ratio recommended)
2. Name them `exercise_{illustration_id}.webp` (e.g., `exercise_push_up_standard.webp`)
3. Place in `app/src/main/res/drawable/`
4. The app will automatically use them instead of placeholders

Users can also replace any exercise image with their own photos via long-press on the image card.

See the full list of illustration IDs in `TrainingProgram.kt`.
